Selenium Cucumber Java Automation Project
This project demonstrates how to automate functional testing for web applications using Selenium, Cucumber, and Java. The key functionalities covered include:
•	Login functionality
•	Cascade dropdown handling
•	Dynamic table interactions
•	Extent Reports integration for detailed test reporting

Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
•	Java 11+
•	Maven (for dependency management)
•	IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
•	Webdrivers (or any other browser driver for Selenium)
________________________________________
Setup
1.	Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/pkz15/Assignment.git

3.	Navigate into the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd selenium-cucumber-java-automation
4.	Install Maven dependencies:
bash
Copy code
mvn clean install
5.	Set up WebDriver for the browser of your choice (e.g., ChromeDriver).

Features
Login Test
This test validates the login functionality by automating the following steps:
1.	Navigate to the login page.
2.	Enter valid/invalid credentials.
3.	Validate successful login or error message.
Cascade Dropdown Handling
This test demonstrates how to handle cascading dropdowns (dependent dropdowns). It automates:
1.	Selecting a value in the parent dropdown.
2.	Waits for the child dropdown to be populated dynamically.
3.	Selects a value from the child dropdown.
Dynamic Table Handling
This test automates interaction with dynamic tables, including:
1.	Searching for a specific row.
2.	Performing actions (e.g., add , delete) on a row in the dynamic table.
3.	Validating the expected result based on dynamic length.

Running Tests
You can run the tests in different ways:
•	To run all tests:
bash
Copy code
mvn test
•	To run a specific feature:
bash
Copy code
mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @Login"
Running Tests with Cucumber
1.	The feature files are stored in the src/test/resources folder under the features directory.
2.	Cucumber options are defined in the @CucumberOptions annotation in the runner class.
3.	You can run the tests directly through Maven using the cucumber plugin.

Extent Reports
For reporting, we are using ExtentReports to generate detailed HTML reports. The reports will provide a summary of:
•	Test execution results (pass/fail).
Report Generation
After running the tests, the report can be found under the target/extent-reports directory.
